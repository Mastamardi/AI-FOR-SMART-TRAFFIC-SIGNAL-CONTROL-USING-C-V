TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
==============================

Q1: Why did we choose YOLOv8 instead of YOLOv4 or other models?
--------------------------------------------------------------
- YOLOv4 required more computational power and struggled in low-light conditions, reducing accuracy.
- Models like SSD and Faster R-CNN were either too slow or less accurate.
- YOLOv8 offers faster inference, higher accuracy, and runs efficiently on the M1 chip with Apple MPS acceleration.

Q2: How does the adaptive traffic control logic work?
----------------------------------------------------
- For each direction, the system calculates green time using:
  `green_time = base + (k × vehicle_count)`
- Base is 15 seconds, k is 2 seconds per vehicle.
- Green time is constrained between 10 and 60 seconds for safety and fairness.
- The direction with the highest vehicle count (and thus green time) is prioritized.

Q3: How do we ensure accurate vehicle counting per direction?
-------------------------------------------------------------
- Each uploaded video/image represents one direction (North, South, East, West).
- YOLOv8 detects vehicles and returns bounding boxes and centroids per frame.
- Counts are derived per direction; no complex tracking is required since each input is direction-specific.

Q4: How is Apple MPS used in this project?
------------------------------------------
- Apple Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) allow PyTorch to run YOLOv8 on the M1 GPU.
- This provides 3–5x faster inference compared to CPU and keeps the system running in near-real time.
- If MPS isn’t available, the system can still run with `--device cpu`.

Q5: What happens when all directions have high traffic (60s each)?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- Each direction gets the maximum green time (60 seconds), and the priority is assigned based on the highest vehicle count.
- This ensures that in highly congested scenarios, no direction is starved of green time.

Q6: How do we handle ROI (Region of Interest) in the system?
-----------------------------------------------------------
- By default, no ROI is needed since each upload corresponds to a specific direction.
- Optional ROI support exists for future extension (e.g., multiple lanes in one video), allowing us to count only vehicles in designated polygons.

Q7: How do we log and analyze traffic data over time?
----------------------------------------------------
- The system logs each phase to `traffic_log.csv`, including timestamp, lane, vehicle count, and green time.
- `scripts/plot_results.py` can be used to generate visualizations of vehicle counts vs. assigned green times over time.
