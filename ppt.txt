SLIDE 3: INTRODUCTION
================================================================================
Introduction to the Work Carried Out During the Internship:
----------------------------------------------------------
During this 12-week summer internship, we developed an intelligent traffic signal 
control system that leverages computer vision and deep learning to optimize traffic 
flow at intersections. The project addresses a critical real-world problem: traditional 
traffic signals operate on fixed timing cycles regardless of actual traffic conditions, 
leading to inefficient flow, increased waiting times, and higher fuel consumption.

Our system employs YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to count vehicles 
in real-time from traffic videos captured from four directions (North, South, East, 
West) of an intersection. An adaptive signal control algorithm calculates optimal 
green time allocations based on vehicle density, with safety constraints between 10-60 
seconds. The system processes traffic data through a user-friendly web interface, 
providing immediate analysis and recommendations.

The work aligns with the CoE's mission of developing AI solutions for smart city 
infrastructure and demonstrates the practical application of deep learning in 
transportation management. This project contributes to the growing field of intelligent 
transportation systems and showcases how modern AI technologies can be deployed to 
solve real-world urban challenges.


SLIDE 4: PROBLEM STATEMENT
================================================================================
Clear Definition of the Problem:
--------------------------------
Current traffic signal systems lack adaptability and fail to respond to real-time 
traffic fluctuations. This leads to:
- Long waiting times at intersections during peak hours
- Inefficient traffic flow with vehicles idling unnecessarily
- High fuel consumption and environmental pollution
- Increased driver frustration and potential safety hazards
- Economic losses due to wasted time and resources
- Fixed-time signals operating on predetermined cycles regardless of actual traffic

Constraints and Assumptions:
---------------------------
Constraints:
- Processing must be real-time (20-40ms per frame)
- System must work with consumer-grade hardware (Apple M1)
- Green time must be constrained between 10-60 seconds for safety
- Detection accuracy must be 95%+ for reliable operation
- System must handle various weather and lighting conditions

Assumptions:
- Traffic videos/images are captured from fixed camera positions
- Each direction (N/S/E/W) is analyzed independently
- Vehicle types include: car, bus, truck, motorcycle, bicycle
- System focuses on four-way intersections
- Camera angles provide clear view of approaching vehicles

Scope of Work (Phase-1 Focus):
-----------------------------
Phase-1 focuses on:
- Real-time vehicle detection from video inputs
- Four-directional traffic analysis (North, South, East, West)
- Adaptive green time calculation based on vehicle density
- Web-based interface for system interaction
- Performance evaluation on collected traffic data
- Single-frame analysis per video (temporal averaging in Phase-2)


SLIDE 5: OBJECTIVES OF THE INTERNSHIP
================================================================================
Minimum 2-3 Objectives Achieved During Internship:
--------------------------------------------------

Objective 1: Develop Real-Time Vehicle Detection System
------------------------------------------------------
Successfully implemented a real-time vehicle detection system using YOLOv8 that 
processes traffic videos and images to identify and count vehicles. The system 
achieves 95%+ detection accuracy with processing times of 20-40ms per frame using 
Apple MPS acceleration. The detection covers multiple vehicle types including cars, 
buses, trucks, motorcycles, and bicycles.

Objective 2: Implement Adaptive Traffic Signal Control Mechanism
----------------------------------------------------------------
Developed and implemented an adaptive signal control algorithm that dynamically 
optimizes signal timings based on real-time vehicle density. The algorithm calculates 
green time using the formula: Green_Time = max(10, min(60, Base_Time + (k × Vehicle_Count))), 
where Base_Time = 15 seconds and k = 2 seconds per vehicle. The system successfully 
identifies priority directions and allocates appropriate green times, demonstrating 
significant improvements over fixed-time signals.

Objective 3: Create User-Friendly Interface for Traffic Analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------
Built a comprehensive web-based interface using Flask that allows users to upload 
traffic videos/images from four directions and receive immediate analysis including 
vehicle counts, suggested green times, priority direction recommendations, and 
visual previews with detection bounding boxes. The interface provides intuitive 
interaction without requiring complex configuration.
